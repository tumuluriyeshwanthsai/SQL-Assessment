/*The data type of the sign_up_at column is DATETIME. It is for storing a date/time value in the database.
Notice that the values are formatted like:
2015-01-01 18:33:52
So the format is:
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
SQLite comes with a strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.
It takes two arguments:
strftime(format, column)
Letâ€™s test this function out:

SELECT sign_up_at,
   strftime('%S', sign_up_at)
FROM users
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;
Now, using this function, query for the sign up counts for each hour.*/
